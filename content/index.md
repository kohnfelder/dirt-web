## Origin Story

Static site generators are wonderful, but for me they are all way too much.
Too many features, tons of configuration, there are layouts and themes, and
there were simple things that I never did figure out how to do. I'm sure that
experts can work magic, but I wanted something so simple it would just work,
and was glad to give up features and control of presentation to get it.

That's the inspiration for *dirt* -- markdown files, some images perhaps,
and a minimalist set of features to keep everything as simple as possible.
You have lots of latitude with content but must leave the presentation details
(fonts, layout, and all that) to the HTML framework(s) that dirt supports.

There are many SSG out there, but there's room for a truly *dirt* simple one.

## History

* May 2023: Revived the project and with crucial help whipped it into shape.

* July 2022: A primitive "MVP" feature set and decent test coverage
(then mothballed).

* June 2022: Beginning of the dirt project, within days it was limping along.
